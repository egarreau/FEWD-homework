				<h4>Labels include (but are not limited to): tea junkie, bookworm, Virginian, world traveler, big-mouthed introvert, list addict. I wish I could learn everything about everything, so I try to work on that in my free time. I read a lot, knit a lot, talk a lot. I love live performances of all kinds. I am wordy as all hell. I'm from the middle of the woods in Virginia, newly transplanted to Boston. I am interested in creative computing, community creation, and the intersections between art, technology, and human interaction. <a href="www.evangelinegarreau.com">This tumblog</a> is a hodge-podge magpie collection of the things I come across in these fine tubes that inspire me, interest me, light me up and set my mind whirling. If you like them we should hang out maybe. </h4>
